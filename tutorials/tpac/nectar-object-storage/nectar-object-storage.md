# Object Storage

## Overview

Duration: 3:00

### What is Object Storage

Object Storage is a way of storing and retrieving data in the cloud. All data is stores as *objects*, directly alongside any amount of metadata. There's no directory tree, just objects, and optionally containers (sometimes buckets). Accessing object storage is done via an API, via URLs and a large and growing number of tools can be configured to access or manage object stores. Object storage is great for scale, availability, and concurrency.

Nectar provides OpenStack Swift for object storage. Hosting of Swift is geodistributed across the nodes of the research cloud.

### What you'll learn

- Managing objects and containers using the Nectar Dashboard
- Using *Cyberduck* and `rclone` to access your Object Store
- Using the OpenStack CLI
- Mounting object storage using CloudFuse

### What you'll need

- Understanding of the OpenStack CLI
- Understanding of -and access to- your OpenStack `.rc`-file
- An allocation with an Object Storage quota
