# Cloud Starter

## Cloud Starter

### Welcome

Welcome to the **Cloud Starter** tutorial series. In this curriculum we've put together all the tutorials that you need to get started using the Cloud, no prior cloud knowledge required.

positive
: This curriculum is technical in nature. You will learn *how* to use the cloud, not *why*. It is also entry-level: you'll learn *one* (easy) way of doing some things, not *all*.

### What you'll learn

- Accessing and Navigating the Nectar Dashboard
- Managing your Public-Private keypair
- Managing Security Groups
- Launching and connecting to your Virtual Machine (VM)
- Using the command line and installing/updating software on your VM

- Working with allocations

### What you'll need

- An account on the Nectar Research Cloud, or the AAF Access to get one.
- Basic computer skills
- [Terminal software](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000223964-terminal-software).
